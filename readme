We have created a single meadow object in which the ants are free to roam
around and try to get their anthill to be the top dog.

The meadow contains the majority of the code because we are constantly having to search
through the meadow to get to the hills and to get to the ants wherever they may be.
There is a method inside the meadow called startFarm() in which the game starts.
The QueenAnts are called to go about their ways from here, food is placed all around the meadow,
and then the cycling starts. While we cycle, we make the ants move around and then do their specialty
(build, collect food and fight.) We also have a backup if the warriors are never able to take down a colony, basically
if there are no ants left in the hill then the hill dies by default.
We also print a summary of the hills in the meadow every 5 cycles.

The cell contains a hill, food and ants.

The anthill contains rooms, food, and all three types of ants.

The ant class is a base class for the Forager, Warrior, and builder ants and contains
the move method that they all share.
The antshop creates the different types of forager ants using.
Theses together make up the factory pattern.

The Queen ant builds up the anthills initially and makes sure they have all the right Pieces
before they can be placed in the meadow.

The rooms can only be of specific types and whatever the type is is later used to create more ants.

The driver code just creates an instance of the meadow and then starts the farm.
